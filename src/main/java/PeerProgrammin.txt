Peer Programming:

Implement a class that can Create Read Update and Delete (CRUD) entries from your database dynamically

The connection must be established in a constructor, Be it with passed variales or a hard coded connection

The class should implement at least 4 methods demontrating each aspect of CRUD
Each method should take variables as arguments and use them to construct the query statement

For example, For Update, The method takes in a userID and all the data needed for a new user.
The method then uses string concatination to construct the sql query;


public void updateUser(int userID, String newUserName) {
	String query = "UPDATE users SET userID =" + userID + ", userName =" + newUserName + "WHERE userID =" + "userID";
	etc.
	etc.
}




Extension, fully implement CRUD for each table in the following database structure;

users:                                        products:                                      orders:
userID - Int PrimaryKey, AutoIncrement        productID - Int PrimaryKey, AutoIncrement      orderID - Int PrimaryKey, AutoIncrement
userName - varChar, Unique                    productName - varChar                          productID - Int ForeignKey
password - varChar                            price - Double                                 userID - Int ForeignKey
firstName - varChar                           stock - int                                    quantity - Int
lastName - varChar                                                                           price - Double



Note, Deleting a User or Product entry will require you to first remove all entries containing that ForeignKey from the orders table.
